## Supabase project
Project: Noshville POS
URL: https://gknaqtvkqjwqwkovmajg.supabase.co

The frontend uses the Supabase **publishable key**, which is intended for browser use. Row Level Security remains the main protection.

## One-time first manager setup
1. In Supabase > Noshville POS > SQL Editor, run `setup_first_manager.sql`.
2. Open the POS and create your first account.
3. Sign in.
4. If needed, run this in the browser console:
   `sb.rpc('bootstrap_first_manager')`
   OR temporarily expose/use the bootstrap action after signing in.
5. Refresh the POS. The account will become Manager.
6. The function refuses to create another first manager after one active manager exists.

## GitHub Pages
Upload these files to the root of the `noshville-pos` repository:
- index.html
- styles.css
- app.js

Then:
1. Repository > Settings > Pages
2. Source: Deploy from branch
3. Branch: `main` / root
4. Save

The temporary GitHub Pages URL will be similar to:
`https://ericchibasa-a11y.github.io/noshville-pos/`

## Custom domain later
After the POS is tested:
- GitHub Pages custom domain: `pos.noshville.co.za`
- GoDaddy DNS: create CNAME `pos` -> `ericchibasa-a11y.github.io`

Do not change DNS until the GitHub Pages version is working.

## Important V1 note
Sales are currently written in two steps: sale header, then sale items. The existing database trigger deducts stock when sale items are inserted.
For higher resilience in V2, move sale completion into one database RPC transaction.

## V1.1 fixes
- Cash tendered now shows live customer change before completing a sale.
- Cash-up variance stays blank until actual cash is entered.
- Sale search field width fixed.
- Purchase cost logic changed to weighted-average inventory cost.
- Run `fix_weighted_average_cost.sql` once in the Noshville Supabase SQL Editor.

## V1.2 low-stock visibility
- SALE screen shows a **LOW STOCK** badge when stock is at or below the reorder level.
- SALE screen shows **OUT OF STOCK** at zero stock and blocks adding that product to the cart.
- Reorder Monitor displays **YES** as a clear red warning.
- No changes were made to the tested sales, weighted-average costing, cash-up, expense, or profit logic.

## V1.3 Stock Count / Adjustment
- Manager-only Stock Count screen.
- Compare system quantity with a physical count.
- Positive differences are recorded as `adjustment_in`.
- Negative differences are recorded as `adjustment_out`.
- Recent stock adjustments remain visible as an audit trail.
- Tested V1.2 sales, weighted-average costing, cash-up, expense, profit and low-stock logic are unchanged.

## V1.4 Users & Salespersons
- Adds manager-only USERS / STAFF tab.
- Managers can create staff authentication accounts with name, email, temporary password and role.
- Managers can switch Salesperson/Manager role and activate/deactivate staff.
- Public self-registration button is removed.
- Inactive accounts are blocked from the POS.
- Requires the `manage-staff` Supabase Edge Function and V1.4 security SQL patch supplied with this package.
- V1.3 sales, stock, purchases, weighted-average costing, stock count, expenses, cash-up and reports are preserved.
